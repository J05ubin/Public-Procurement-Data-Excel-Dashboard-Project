##  Public-Procurement-Data-Excel-Dashboard-Project
This project presents an interactive data analysis dashboard built using Microsoft Excel to study public procurement (tender) data from Assam for the years 2021–2022. 
The dashboard helps identify procurement trends, department activity, tender values, and bidding patterns.

##  Project Objective
The goal of this project is to analyze Assam’s public procurement data and uncover insights related to:
- Distribution of tender categories  
- Major procuring departments  
- High-value infrastructure projects  
- Tender stages and bidder participation  
- Year-wise procurement activity  
The dashboard is designed to support policymakers, researchers, and procurement officials in understanding trends and improving decision-making.

##  Dataset
The dataset used in this project is Assam Public Procurement Data (2021–2022), sourced from the Government of India Open Data Portal.

##  Tools & Technologies Used
- Microsoft Excel  
- Pivot Tables  
- Charts & Graphs  
- Slicers for interactivity  
- Data Cleaning & Filtering

##  Dashboard Analysis & Key Findings

# 1. Distribution of Tender Categories
   A pie chart shows that:
   - Works tenders dominate (76%)
   - Goods account for 17%
   - Services account for 7%
   This indicates a strong focus on infrastructure development such as roads and public facilities. 

# 2. Top Procuring Departments
   A bar chart highlights departments with the highest number of tenders:
   - Public Works Roads Department (833 tenders)
   - Assam Power Distribution Company Ltd (313)
   - Department of Water Resources (308)
   This reflects heavy investment in transport and utility infrastructure.

# 3. High-Value Tenders
   A value distribution chart shows several tenders in the multi-crore INR range, with the highest exceeding ₹9.5 billion. These large projects mainly belong to infrastructure and water resource sectors. 
   
# 4. Tender Stages & Bidder Participation
   - Most tenders are in the AOC stage with strong bidder competition (avg. 6.16 bidders)
   - 836 tenders were cancelled**, indicating possible planning or execution issues
   This suggests competitive procurement but also highlights inefficiencies that need attention.

# 5. Year-wise Tender Activity
   - 2021: 3,451 tenders
   - 2022: 1,239 tenders
   The sharp drop in 2022 may be due to budget constraints, project completion, or post-pandemic adjustments.

# Dashboard Features
The Excel dashboard includes:
✔ Interactive slicers (Department, Year, Quarter, Category, Stage)  
✔ Pivot-based charts and summaries  
✔ Trend analysis across time and departments  
✔ Visual representation of procurement hotspots  
These features allow dynamic exploration of data and trends. 

# Key Conclusions
- Infrastructure and utility sectors dominate government tenders  
- There is healthy bidding competition in awarded contracts  
- High-value tenders indicate major public infrastructure investments  
- Procurement intensity shifted significantly between 2021 and 2022
